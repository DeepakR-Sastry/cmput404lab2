Q1) You can create a socket by specifying the address family and the transfer protocol and using the .socket() function. You must also use socket.SOCK_stream as an argument to the .socket() function to specify that it is a TCP socket.
Q2) The server socket responds to the requests from the client. You must bind the server to an address and a port and  listen to incoming connections. On the client socket, it acts as the initiator of the connection. Basically, client socket requests and the server socket services the requests.
Q3) The socket library has a .setsockopt() function which we can use to let us reuse the same address (set socket.SO_REUSEADDR to true).
Q4) We get the IP address and the outgoing port of the client.
Q5) recv() just returns an empty string to signify the end of the message.
